I am an Assistant Professor of Writing Studies in the Department of English at Northern Illinois University. My research centers on multilingual writing, rhetorical genre studies, multimodal composing, and AI-assisted writing. You can find my work published in leading peer-reviewed journals in the fields of writing studies and applied linguistics, such as Journal of Second Language Writing, Computers and Composition, and Applied Linguistics. I have taught a range of college writing courses and previously served in an administrative role in the Writing Program at the University of Arizona.
